Generate realistic sound waves directly within Figma based on input audio files. This plugin processes audio data and creates accurate waveform visualization, making it easy to represent sound in your designs. Supports commonly used audio formats: MP4A, MP3, and WAV.

This is my first plugin so feedback is much appreciated!
